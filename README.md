# Analyzing Coronavirus (COVID-19) Deaths Data Using SQL

This project aims to analyze COVID-19 deaths data using SQL queries. By leveraging SQL, we can extract insights from the dataset and visualize the impact of the pandemic on different regions.

## Project Overview

The project focuses on several key aspects:
1. **Total Cases vs Total Deaths**: Analyzing the relationship between total cases and total deaths to understand the mortality rate of COVID-19 and estimate the likelihood of dying if one contracts COVID-19 in their country.

2. **Total Cases vs Population**: Determining the percentage of the population infected with COVID-19 in various countries.

3. **Countries with Highest Infection Rate compared to Population**: Identifying countries with the highest infection rates relative to their population size.

4. **Countries with Highest Death Count per Population**: Highlighting countries with the highest death count per population, indicating the severity of the pandemic.

5. **Showing Continent with the Highest Death Count per Population**: Analyzing which continent has the highest death count per population.

6. **Total Population vs Vaccinations**: Analyzing the percentage of the population that has received at least one COVID-19 vaccine dose.
